CAT810 Node Image Dumper
========================

I had just started playing with Node.js and liked the idea of writing everything in javascript. For a while
I'd been writing code to generate images using <canvas> but had no realistic way of saving the images down
to the file-system (specifically for frames for an animation).

This was the first stab at some node code, which takes BASE64 encoded images POSTed over, decodes them and
drops them to the file system.

Short and Sweet.

TODO
====

+ Probably clean up some code somewhere.
